/**
 * Regenerate test/fixtures/live-input-schema.json from the actor's LIVE build.
 *
 * Why this script exists. The parity test asserts that the tool exposes every
 * input the live actor exposes. On 2026-08-16 that test was passing while
 * asserting something false: its expected list was hand maintained and had been
 * reconciled against the tool rather than against the actor, so when the actor
 * gained `concurrency` and the tool did not, the list agreed with the tool and
 * the gap stayed hidden. A parity check built from the thing it is checking is
 * not a check.
 *
 * So the expected list is now derived from a fixture, and the fixture is
 * produced BY THIS SCRIPT from the platform, never by hand and never from
 * src/index.ts. Run it after any actor build that changes the input schema:
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-input-schema-fixture.mjs
 *
 * The test itself stays offline and needs no token, which matters because the
 * tests deliberately run with APIFY_TOKEN unset.
